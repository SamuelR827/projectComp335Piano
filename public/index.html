  <h1>Welcome to our COMP 335 Final Project!</h1>
  <p>This is the final project of Samuel Rantz and Amber Chaves. 
    We have created an interactive piano that you can either click 
  the keys with your mouse or using your computer's keyboard. 
  The symbols below the piano in red show the corresponding key 
  on the computer keyboard. Enjoy and play whatever you would like! </p>
